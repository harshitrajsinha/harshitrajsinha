# Hi there, I'm Harshit! 👋

🚀 **Full-Stack Developer, specialized in Backend Technologies**

I'm a software engineer leveraging **Golang, JavaScript, PHP** and related frameworks to build robust and scalable solutions in and around web.
I have till now worked in two companies, both in fintech and web development domains where my role involved crafting intuitive UI components using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, while handling backend functionalities with **PHP**. I have built custom UI components and plugins, allowing businesses and startups to create dynamic web experiences
Through this I have gained valuable insights into user expectations and product development. This experience has strengthened my ability to deliver high-quality, user-centric solutions while continuously upskilling myself.
